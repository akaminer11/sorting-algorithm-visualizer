# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is an extension of the speed testing project that I did before. It just visualizes the algorithms. The merge sort visualization doesn't really work, but the actual algorithm does.
It works from the command line.
Heavily inspired by a blog post I saw somewhere, and I used some of that code to help me when I got stuck, but it's mostly my own code.

## Usage
Use --list as an arg to see all of the commands. 

## System Requirements
Have pygame and python 3.7 at least.
